# CS210 Portfolio Project

Portfolio submission for CS 210 Module Eight Journal.

## Project Summary
For this portfolio, I selected the Text-Based Adventure Game Project, which was designed to provide users with an interactive experience where they could navigate through different rooms, collect items, and ultimately complete an objective. This project allowed me to practice my skills in C++ by creating a functional, menu-driven program that handled user inputs, game logic, and item tracking.

## What Did I Do Well?
In this project, I did particularly well with organizing the code into clean, reusable functions and keeping the overall structure simple and easy to follow. I ensured that each function had a clear purpose, which made the code more readable and maintainable. I also took extra care to handle invalid user input to make the game more user-friendly.

## Where Could I Enhance My Code?
One area I could enhance my code is optimizing how the inventory system works. Currently, it uses basic arrays, but upgrading to a more advanced data structure like a vector or map could make the code more scalable and efficient, especially if the game were to grow with more items and rooms. Additionally, improving error handling and input validation would make the program more secure.

## Challenges and Solutions
The most challenging part of this project was setting up the navigation system so that the player could move between rooms logically without getting stuck or breaking the game. I overcame this by drawing out the room connections on paper first, which helped me visualize the layout. I also referred to class materials and online documentation to make sure my logic was sound and tested each scenario thoroughly.

## Transferable Skills
From this project, I gained several skills that will be helpful in future projects, including:
- Writing modular, reusable functions.
- Managing program flow and user inputs.
- Using version control with GitHub to track changes and collaborate.
- Applying problem-solving techniques to debug and test programs.

## Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
I made sure this program was maintainable by breaking the code into smaller, manageable functions and adding comments throughout the code to explain what each part does. I kept naming conventions consistent and descriptive, which improved readability. Lastly, I designed the program to be adaptable by making it easy to add new rooms, items, or features without having to rewrite large sections of code.
